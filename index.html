            <h2>MARCUS</h2>
            <p>I frequently get asked how and when I first got started working out. Well, I was first motivated to workout as a kid by watching “The Incredible Hulk” on T.V. The size and strength of the Hulk captivated me and from there I was hooked.<br>
                    ​
                    I first started lifting weights at the tender age of 12 when my big brother from the Big Brother’s program enrolled me on his membership. From there, I worked on developing my body and mind as it kept me away from trouble.</p>

                <p>I enjoy motivating others, traveling, music, camping, going to the beach etc… I eat, sleep and breathe health and fitness. Health and fitness has formed the foundation of my social, academic, and work life. I utilize what is known at the FITT principle, which stands for Frequency, Intensity, Time& Type. <br>The most important thing to me is that you achieve your fitness goals in the shortest possible time, and in the most enjoyable manner.</p>

                <h2>Cardio</h2>
                <p>Cardio exercise is one of the most important things you can do for your body, whether you want to lose weight, burn fat, or generally improve your health. You can use machines like a treadmill or an elliptical trainer, or you can create your own workout at home with a variety of cardio exercises like jogging in place, jumping jacks, or burpees. Anything that gets your heart rate into your target heart rate zone will work, but there are some workouts that give you a little more bang for your buck.</p>

                <h2>Strenght</h2>
                <p>When properly performed, strength training can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall health and well-being, including increased bone, muscle, tendon, and ligament strength and toughness, increased fitness and improved cardiac function. Training commonly uses the technique of progressively increasing the force output of the muscle through incremental weight increases and uses a variety of exercises to target specific muscle groups.</p>
